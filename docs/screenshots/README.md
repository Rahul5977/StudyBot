## Usage Instructions

To capture screenshots for documentation:

1. **Setup Demo Environment**

   - Start backend and frontend servers
   - Load sample documents
   - Prepare demo data

2. **Capture High-Quality Screenshots**

   - Use browser developer tools to set consistent viewport
   - Ensure consistent UI state (no loading spinners)
   - Include relevant content (no Lorem ipsum)

3. **File Naming Convention**

   - Format: `NN_feature_description.png`
   - Use descriptive names
   - Maintain consistent numbering

4. **Screenshot Specifications**
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Format: PNG for UI screenshots, SVG for diagrams
   - Compress for web use while maintaining quality

## Sample Data for Screenshots

### Documents to Upload

- `machine_learning_textbook.pdf` (45 pages)
- `statistics_handbook.pdf` (120 pages)
- `data_science_guide.xlsx` (Multiple sheets)

### Sample Study Plans

- "Machine Learning Fundamentals" (6 weeks)
- "Statistics for Data Science" (4 weeks)
- "Python Programming Basics" (3 weeks)

### Sample Chat Queries

- "Explain gradient descent with examples"
- "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?"
- "How do I interpret a confusion matrix?"

### Sample Flashcards

- Q: "What is overfitting?" A: "When a model learns training data too specifically..."
- Q: "Define cross-validation" A: "A technique to assess model performance..."
- Q: "What is regularization?" A: "Methods to prevent overfitting by adding penalties..."

## Image Editing Guidelines

For consistency across all screenshots:

### Annotations

- Use consistent colors for highlights and callouts
- Arrow color: #3B82F6 (blue-500)
- Highlight color: #FBBF24 (yellow-400) with 30% opacity
- Text boxes: White background with subtle drop shadow

### Privacy

- Blur or replace any sensitive information
- Use placeholder names and data
- Ensure no personal information is visible

### Quality Standards

- Sharp, clear images without compression artifacts
- Consistent lighting and contrast
- Proper aspect ratios for different screen sizes

## Future Screenshots Needed
