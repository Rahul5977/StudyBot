    "response": "To create a study plan for Python programming with preferences of '4 weeks' duration and 'beginner' difficulty, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Week 1: Foundations of Python**\n   - Start by learning the basics of Python syntax, data types, variables, and operators.\n   - Work on understanding control flow structures like loops and conditional statements.\n   - Practice writing simple programs to get comfortable with the language.\n\n2. **Week 2: Functions and Modules**\n   - Dive deeper into functions, how to define and call them, and understand the concept of scope.\n   - Explore built-in functions and learn how to create your own functions.\n   - Begin working with modules to organize your code and reuse functionality.\n\n3. **Week 3: Data Structures and Libraries**\n   - Learn about essential data structures like lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.\n   - Explore how to manipulate and iterate over these data structures effectively.\n   - Introduce yourself to popular libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.\n\n4. **Week 4: Projects and Practice**\n   - Start implementing small projects to apply what you've learned so far.\n   - Focus on projects that interest you to stay motivated and engaged.\n   - Practice regularly, solve coding challenges, and seek feedback to improve your skills.\n\nTo deepen your understanding and progress further:\n- Consider working on mini-projects related to your interests or areas you want to specialize in.\n- Engage with Python communities online or join coding forums to exchange ideas and seek help.\n- Continuously challenge yourself with more complex problems to enhance your problem-solving skills.\n\nIf you need additional guidance on specific topics or resources, feel free to ask for more details or recommendations.",
